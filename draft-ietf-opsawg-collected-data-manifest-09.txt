           A Data Manifest for Contextualized Telemetry Data
              draft-ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest-09

Abstract

   Network platforms use Network Telemetry, such as YANG-Push, to
   continuously stream information, including both counters and state
   information.  This document describes the metadata that ensure that
   the collected data can be interpreted correctly.  This document
   specifies the data manifest, composed of two YANG data models (the
   platform manifest and the non-normative data collection manifest).
   These YANG modules are specified at the network level (e.g., network
   controllers) to provide a model that encompasses several network
   platforms.  The data manifest must be streamed and stored along with
   the data, up to the collection and analytics systems to keep the
   collected data fully exploitable by the data scientists and relevant
   tools.  Additionally, this document specifies an augmentation of the
   YANG-Push model to include the actual collection period, in case it
   differs from the configured collection period.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


1.  Introduction

   Network platforms use Network Telemetry, such as YANG-Push [RFC8641],
   to continuously stream information, including both counters and state
   information.

   This document specifies what needs to be kept as metadata to ensure
   that the collected data can still be interpreted correctly throughout
   the collection and network analytics toolchain.  When streaming YANG-
   structured data with YANG-Push, there is a semantic definition in the
   corresponding YANG module definition.  This is the semantic
   information for the collected data nodes: While this semantic is
   absolutely required to correctly decode and interpret the data,
   understanding the network platform and collection environment
   contexts information is equally important to interpret the data.

   One part of this information is the actual collection period, as
   opposed to the configured collection period.  On some platforms, that
   period can be adjusted automatically by the platform, for instance to
   reduce the load incurred by sending the telemetry.  To later exploit
   the collected data, getting this actual collection period is crucial.
   This document defines a YANG model augmenting the YANG-Push model
   [RFC8641] to expose the actual collection period in Section 4.

   This document introduces the data manifest, which is composed of two
   YANG modules, namely, the platform manifest and the data collection
   manifest, to keep the collected data exploitable by the data
   scientists and relevant tools.

   The platform manifest contains information characterizing the
   platform streaming the telemetry information, while the data
   collection manifest contains the required information to characterize
   how and when the telemetry information was metered.  The platform
   manifest is specified in Section 5.  An example of data collection
   manifest is specified in Section 6.  The latter module is non-
   normative due to the lack of design-time schema mount in YANG, see
   Section 1 of [RFC8528].

   These two YANG modules do not expose any new information but rather
   define what should be exposed by a platform streaming or storing
   telemetry data.  Some related YANG modules have been specified to
   retrieve the platform capabilities such as:

   *  "YANG Library" [RFC8525].

   *  "YANG Modules Describing Capabilities for Systems and Datastore
      Update Notifications" [RFC9196] for the platform capabilities
      regarding the production and export of telemetry data.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   *  [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection], which is based on
      [RFC9196] to define the optimal settings to stream specific items
      (i.e., per path).

   These related YANG modules are important to discover the capabilities
   before applying the telemetry configuration (such as on-change
   subscription).  Some of their content is part of the context for the
   streamed data.

   This document covers only metadata about the collection context for
   the telemetry.  The collected data is likely to be transformed into
   usable indicators for the network.  The list of such transformation
   operations applied to the data is often called data lineage.
   Supplying the data lineage for the computed indicators is out of
   scope of this document.

   To retrieve the context in which a particular piece of data was
   collected, three elements are necessary: the time of data emission,
   the originating platform and the subscription through which the data
   arrived.  The approach described in this document delegates the time
   retrieval to the database storing the collected telemetry and
   focusing on providing a way to match a platform and a subscription
   identifier to the collection context.  This is consistent with most
   of the YANG modules for devices, which focus on describing the
   current state of the device, rather than the evolution of that state
   through time.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document reuses the term "Network Telemetry" as defined in
   [RFC9232].

   Platform: equipment of the network able to produce telemetry data.

   Data manifest: The necessary data required to interpret telemetry
   information.

   Platform manifest: part of the data manifest that completely
   characterizes the platform producing the telemetry information.

   Data collection manifest: part of the data manifest that completely
   characterizes how and when the telemetry information was metered.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   Datapoint: an instance of data collected via Network Telemetry at a
   specific time.

   Collector: software that receives the stream of telemetry.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Network Analytics

   Streamed information from network platforms is used for network
   analytics, incident detection, and in the closed control loop for
   network automation.  See [I-D.ietf-nmop-terminology] for definition
   of some of these terms.  This streamed data can be stored in a time-
   series database or processed in a real-time streaming processor for
   further analysis.

   As an example, a database could store a time series representing the
   evolution of a specific counter collected from a network platform.
   When analyzing the data, a network operator/data scientist must
   understand the context information for these data:

   *  This counter definition, typically as defined in the YANG model.

   *  The network platform vendor, model, and OS.

   *  The collection parameters.

   Characterizing the source used for producing the data (vendor,
   platform, and OS) is useful to complement the data.  As an example,
   knowing the exact data source software specification might reveal a
   particularity in the observed data, explained by a specific bug, a
   specific bug fix, or simply a particular specific behavior.  This is
   also necessary to ensure the reliability of the collected data.  On
   top of that, for YANG-Push [RFC8641], it is crucial to know the set
   of YANG modules supported by the platform, along with their
   deviations.  In some cases, there might even be some backwards
   incompatible changes in native modules (i.e., vendor proprietary
   modules) between one OS version to the next one.  This information is
   captured by means of the platform manifest Section 5.

   From a collection parameters point of view, the data scientists
   analyzing the collected data must know whether the counter was
   requested from the network platform as on-change or at specific
   cadence [RFC8641].  Indeed, an on-change collection explains why
   there is a single value as opposed to a time series.  In case of
   periodic collection, this exact cadence might not be observable in
   the time series.  Indeed, this time series might report some values
   as 0 or might even omit some values.  The reason for this behavior



Claise, et al.           Expires 3 January 2026                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   might be diverse: the network platform may be under stress, with a
   too small observation period, compared to the minimum-observed-
   period.  Knowing the conditions under which a counter was collected
   and streamed (along with the platform details) helps drawing the
   informed conclusions.  As an example, some platform might report a
   value of 0 for counters when the collection period is too short with
   respect to the capabilities of the platform.  Without context, this
   value of 0 might lead to a wrong conclusion that the corresponding
   counter dropped to zero.

3.2.  New Device Onboarding

   When a new device is onboarded, operators must check that the new
   device streams data (e.g., with YANG-Push), that the Network
   Telemetry data is the right one, that the data is correctly collected
   at the data collection, and finally that the data can be analyzed
   (compared with other similar devices).  For the last point, the data
   manifest, which must be linked to the data up to the collection and
   analytics system, contains the relevant information.

3.3.  Data Mesh Principles in Networking

   The concept behind the data mesh [DataMesh] are:

   *  Domain Ownership: Architecturally and organizationally align
      business, technology, and analytical data, following the line of
      responsibility.  The Data Mesh principles adopt the boundary of
      bounded context to individual data products where each domain is
      responsible for (and owns) its data and models.

   *  Data as a Product: The "Domain" owners are responsible to provide
      the data in useful way (discoverable through a catalog,
      addressable with a permanent and unique address, understandable
      with well-defined semantics, trustworthy and truthful, self-
      describing for easy consumption, interoperable by supporting
      standards, secure, self-contained, etc.) and should treat
      consumers of that data as customers.  It requires and relies on
      the "Domain Ownership" principle.

   *  Self-serve Data Platform: This fosters the sharing of cross-domain
      data to create extra value.

   *  Federated Computational Governance: Describes the operating model
      and approach to establishing global policies across a mesh of data
      products.

   The most relevant concept for this document is the "Data as a
   Product" principle.  The data manifest fulfills this principle as the
   two YANG data models, platform manifest and the data collection
   manifest, along with the data, provide all the necessary information
   in a self-describing way for easy consumption.

4.  The "ietf-yp-current-period" YANG module

   Some platforms will adjust the collection period depending on their
   capabilities and current load.  The YANG module in this section
   augments the "ietf-subscribed-notification" module to provide the
   "current-period" leaf.  The value of this leaf indicates the current
   collection which might be different from the configured collection
   period.

   Figure 1 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the "ietf-yp-
   current-period" module.

   identifier should be defined by the network manager so that each
   platform emitting Network Telemetry has a unique identifier.  There
   are several documents about managing the inventory of the network,
   e.g., [I-D.ietf-ivy-network-inventory-yang].  The platform identifier

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   should be the same as the identifier used in inventories or the
   'node-id' in [RFC8345].  As an example, the identifier could be the
   'sysName' from [RFC3418].  The scope of the "ietf-platform-manifest"
   module is the scope of the data collection, i.e., a given network,
   therefore it contains a collection of platform manifests, as opposed
   to the device scope, which would contain a single platform manifest.

   The platform manifest is characterized by a set of parameters
   ('name', 'software-version', 'software-flavor', 'os-version', and
   'os-type') that are aligned with the YANG Catalog
   [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog] so that the YANG Catalog could be
   used to retrieve the YANG modules a posteriori.  The vendor of the
   platform can be identified via its name 'vendor' or its PEN number
   'vendor-pen', as described in [RFC9371].

   The platform manifest also includes the contents of the YANG Library
   [RFC8525].  That module set is particularly useful to retrieve the
   YANG modules associated to a subscription by analyzing the xpath
   filters or the subtree filters.  Xpath filters are based on module
   names (see [RFC8639], description of leaf 'stream-xpath-filter', page
   45).  Subtree filters are based on namespaces.

6.  Data Collection Manifest

   This section is non-normative.

6.1.  Overview of the Model

   Figure 3 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the "example-
   collection-manifest" module.  The module relies upon the YANG Schema
   mount [RFC8528] to reuse existing YANG modules describing the current
   data collection status.  This module is an example, i.e. non-
   normative, as YANG Schema mount does not support design-time schema
   mount.  Appendix C explains how the YANG tree is obtained.

     Figure 3: YANG tree diagram for example-collection-manifest module

   The 'data-collections' container contains the information related to
   each YANG-Push subscription.  As for the platform manifest, these
   subscriptions are indexed by the 'platform-id', so that all
   subscriptions in the network can be represented at the network level
   without any conflict.

   As most of the information related to YANG-push subscription
   [RFC8639] and [RFC8641] is stored in the "ietf-yang-push" module,
   these modules are mounted.  These modules have a part common to all
   subscriptions of the platform, stored in the 'streams' and 'filters'
   containers.  The information about subscriptions themselves are
   stored in the 'subscriptions/subscription' list, indexed by a
   subscription identifier.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   In the subscription object, the 'current-period' indicates the period
   currently used between two updates.  That leaf can only be present
   when the subscription is periodic.  The current period might differ
   from the requested period if the platform implements a mechanism to
   increase the collection period when it is overloaded.  Having the
   current period information is crucial to understand if telemetry is
   missing because of a bug or a packet loss or simply because it was
   dynamically adjusted by the platform.

   The 'current-period' data node is added by the module 'ietf-data-
   collection-manifest-statistics' presented in Section 4.  This module
   augments the subscription list from the module 'ietf-subscribed-
   notifications'.  It is mounted as well via the YANG Schema Mount
   mechanism.  The module for the data collection manifest is presented
   in Section 6.2.

6.2.  The "example-collection-manifest" YANG module

   This section includes the code of the "example-collection-manifest"
   YANG module.  Additionally, it defines the extension data file for
   YANG schema mount.  The data collection manifest should conform to
   the model obtained by combining these two specifications.

7.  Data Manifest and the Collected Data

   This section focuses on associating the collected data to the data
   manifest.  As this document specifically focuses on giving context on
   data collected via Network Telemetry, it is assumed that a Network
   Telemetry system is available.  Another premise of this document is
   the storage of the collected data into a database for later
   exploitation.  This document assumes that such a database exists and
   can be used for storing the data manifest.

7.1.  Collecting the Data Manifest

   The data manifest MUST be streamed and stored along with the
   collected data.  In case the collected data are moved to a different
   place (typically a database), the companion data manifest MUST follow
   the collected data.  Storing the collected data without the companion
   data manifest might prevent the correct interpretation of the
   collected data.  The data manifest MUST be updated when the data
   manifest information changes, for example, when a router is upgraded,
   when a new Network Telemetry subscription is configured, or when the
   Network Telemetry subscription parameters change.  The data manifest
   can itself be considered as a time series, and stored in a similar
   fashion to the collected data.

   This document recommends reusing existing Network Telemetry systems
   (in-band approach) to lower the efforts for implementing this
   approach.  To enable a platform supporting Network Telemetry to also
   support the data manifest, it is sufficient that this platform



Claise, et al.           Expires 3 January 2026                [Page 19]

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   supports the models from Sections 5 and 6.  The collection of the
   data manifest MUST be explicitly configured by the collector by
   requesting the relevant subscriptions.  These subscriptions MUST
   include the platform manifest and the data collection manifest,
   possibly limited to the subscriptions for which the context needs to
   be retrieved a posteriori.  Appendix B shows how the in-band approach
   would work while storing to a time series database.

   Each type of manifest has its own rough frequency update, i.e., at
   reboot for the platform manifest and when subscriptions are modified
   for the data collection manifest.  The data manifest SHOULD be
   streamed with the YANG-Push on-change feature [RFC8641] (also called
   event-driven telemetry) whenever possible.

   A platform manifest is likely to remain the same until the platform
   is updated.  Thus, the platform manifest only needs to be collected
   once per streaming session and updated after a platform reboot.  The
   "subscription-terminated" (Section 2.7.3 of [RFC8639]) will indicate
   to the collector that the platform rebooted.  The collector MUST then
   collect the potential update of the platform manifest on re-
   establishment of the subscription.  Using the on-change feature
   enables to capture dynamic changes to the platform manifest as well,
   if any.

   Regarding the data manifest, the elements common to all
   subscriptions, such as the stream definitions and the common filters
   might be updated less frequently than the subscriptions.  Relying on
   YANG-Push on-change feature enables keeping an up-to-date version of
   the data collection manifest.

   The underlying time series database should accommodate the various
   rates at which different parts of the data manifest are updated.  In
   particular, storing the platform manifest should be optimized to
   avoid duplicating repeated content and only storing a new version
   when there is a change in the manifest.

7.2.  Mapping Collected Data to the Data Manifest

   As explained in the introduction, three elements are necessary to
   identify the data manifest associated to a datapoint:

   *  the time at which the data was sent from the device,

   *  the originating platform sending the data, and

   *  the identifier of the subscription that produced the data.





Claise, et al.           Expires 3 January 2026                [Page 20]

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   These elements can be either known to the collector, if it is the one
   configuring the collection, or retrieved via dedicated headers as
   proposed, e.g., in [I-D.netana-netconf-notif-envelope].  To enable a
   posteriori retrieval of the data manifest associated to a datapoint,
   the collector MUST keep the subscription identifier and platform
   identifier in the metadata of the collected values.

   With these three elements, to retrieve the data manifest from a
   datapoint, the following happens:

   *  The subscription identifier, platform identifier and timestamp of
      the data are retrieved from the datapoint metadata

   *  The platform manifest for that datapoint is obtained by looking up
      the latest version before the timestamp matching the platform
      identifier.

   *  The data collection manifest for that datapoint is obtained by
      looking up the latest version before the timestamp matching the
      platform identifier and the subscription identifier.

   The reliability of the collection of the data manifest is the same as
   the reliability of the data collection itself, since the data
   manifest is like any other data.

8.  Operational Considerations

   The data manifest is partially standardized in this document since
   only the platform manifest has a normative YANG module.  Section 6.1
   explains why the data collection manifest cannot be normative at the
   current time.  In practice, the data collection manifest might be
   difficult to implement due to the dependency on YANG Schema Mount and
   the lack of normative YANG module.  In that case, the solution
   proposed in the next paragraph covers the creation of the data
   collection manifest.

   It is expected that the data manifest is streamed directly from the
   network equipment, along with YANG-Push [RFC8641] data.  However, if
   the equipment Network Telemetry does not yet support the YANG modules
   from the data manifest specified in this document, the telemetry
   collector could populate the data manifest from available information
   collected from the platform.  This latter option requires efforts on
   the Network Telemetry data collection side, as the information
   gathered in the data manifest proposed in this document could be
   scattered among various standard and vendor-specific YANG modules
   [RFC8199], that depend on the platform.





Claise, et al.           Expires 3 January 2026                [Page 21]

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   The current approach relies on the hostname for identifying the
   various platform, which identifies a role rather than a particular
   piece of hardware.  As a consequence, there is no simple solution for
   obtaining the data manifest of a given piece of hardware reused for
   different roles in the same network.  In general, the problem of
   having consistent metadata among various protocols is still an open
   problem as detailed in Section 4.10 of
   [I-D.boucadair-nmop-rfc3535-20years-later].

                     Figure 4: Example of data manifest

   Figure 4 contains the data collection manifest for two XPaths
   subscriptions.  With the data collection manifest for the first one,
   with subscription identifier 4242, the exact semantics of the
   collected path, here the administrative status of the network
   interfaces, can be obtained by looking up the module in the yang-
   library of the corresponding platform manifest, to obtain the exact
   revision of ietf-interfaces used at collection time.  Also, the "on-
   change" container indicates that data will be sent only if there is a
   change, thus not receiving data indicates that the administrative
   status of the interface did not change.

   The other example of data collection manifest, with subscription
   identifier 4243, shows how a periodic subscription is reported.  In
   that example, the 'current-period' indicates that the requested
   period of 10s (1000 centiseconds) could not be attained and is now of
   20s, for instance because the device is overloaded.

10.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template described in Section 3.7
   of [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc8407bis].

   The "ietf-platform-manifest" module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF[RFC8040].  These protocols have to use
   a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC6242], TLS [RFC8446] and QUIC
   [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

   *  platforms/platform contains details about the platform that an
      attacker could use to find the known vulnerabilities of the
      platform.

   The "ietf-yp-current-period" module defines a data model that is
   designed to be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF[RFC8040].  These protocols have to use
   a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC6242], TLS [RFC8446] and QUIC
   [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Specifically, the following
   subtrees and data nodes have particular sensitivities/
   vulnerabilities:

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2025


   There are no particularly sensitive readable data nodes.

   As the present approach reuses an existing telemetry system, the
   security considerations lie with the new content divulged in the new
   manifests.  Appropriate access control filters must be associated to
   the corresponding leafs and containers, as well as the databases
   storing them.

   The integrity and provenance of the data of the collection manifest
   can be ensured by a signing mechanism such as
   [I-D.lopez-opsawg-yang-provenance].

11.  IANA Considerations

   RFC Ed.: replace XXXX with actual RFC number and remove this note.

   IANA is requested to register the following URIs in the "ns"

13.  Open Issues

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   *  Do we want to handle the absence of values, i.e. add information
      about missed collection or errors in the collection context ? It
      could also explain why some values are missing.  On the other
      hand, this might also be out scope.  CLOSED: the goal of the
      manifest is to be able to detect miscollection a posteriori.
      Assurance of the metric collection is out of scope and could be
      done via an external mechanism such as SAIN.

   *  Henk: how does this interact with SBOM effort?  CLOSED: SBOM is
      another kind of manifest, we are focusing here on data collection.

   *  What is the link with the RFC8345 NodeId and IVY?  CLOSED: added
      text.

   *  Handling of deletion in [I-D.kll-yang-label-tsdb].  CLOSED: out of
      scope

Appendix B.  An Example of Use Based on MDT

   In this example, the goal is to collect the administrative status and
   number of received bytes for the interfaces of a fictional ACME
   device, and store the result in a time-series database.  The metrics
   are collected using YANG-Push, which is configured by specifying
   their XPaths and when they should be collected (periodically or on-
   change).  More precisely, the Xpaths to collect are "ietf-
   interfaces:interfaces/interface/enabled" on every change and "ietf-
   interfaces:interfaces/interface/statistics/in-octets" every 100
   milliseconds.  The paths here are referring to the YANG module from
   [RFC8343].  The configuration of YANG push is out of scope for this
   document.  Since they don’t have the same trigger, each of the path
   must be collected in its own subscription.  Figure 5 presents an
   example for such a collection.

          Figure 5: Example of Collection From a Device to a TSDB

   In the scenario depicted in Figure 5, the collector receives YANG-
   push data from the device and stores it into a time series database
   (TSDB).  This section first presents a version without data manifest
   and then how to enrich it with the data manifest.

   Examples rely on the notation from [I-D.kll-yang-label-tsdb] to
   represent how the data is stored in the TSDB.  Without the data
   manifest, the result of the collection would be stored as showed in
   Figure 6.  The "host" label indicates the devices from which the data
   is collected and the YANG keys are included as well.  Here the
   interface "eth0" is enabled and received 1234 octets.  In that case,
   the value is stored, without any way to know how the value was
   obtained.

    * Metric: interfaces_interface_enabled
    * Value: True
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - interfaces_interface_name: "eth0"
   --
    * Metric: interfaces_interface_statistics_in_octets
    * Value: 1234
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - interfaces_interface_name: "eth0"

             Figure 6: Storing Datapoints without Data Manifest

   An option for keeping the data manifest with the data is to store it
   directly into the TSDB.  In that case, the collector can subscribe to
   the data exported by the module presented in this document and store
   it as other metrics.  For the platform manifest, assuming the
   platform identifier is "PE1", the collector subscribes to the path
   "ietf-platform-manifest:platforms/platform[id=PE1]".  For the data
   collection manifests, the collector subscribes to the path "ietf-

   data-collection-manifest:data-collections/data-collection[platform-
   id="PE1"]/yang-push-collection/subscriptions/subscription[id=X]"
   where X is the subscription identifier of existing subscriptions.
   With the approach from [I-D.kll-yang-label-tsdb], the corresponding
   subtrees would be split into a set of datapoints, one per leaf.
   Figure 7 shows two examples of storing leaves in a TSDB.  The first
   leaf is the vendor PEN number, which is part of the platform
   manifest.  The second leaf is the Xpath filter used for subscription
   to the interface status.

    * Metric: platforms_platform_vendor_pen
    * Value: 32473
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - platforms_platform_id: "PE1"
   --
    * Metric: data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_collection_
              subscriptions_subscription_datastore_xpath_filter
    * Value: "ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface/enabled"
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - data_collections_data_collection_platform_id: "PE1"
      - data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_collection_
        subscriptions_subscription_id: 4242

         Figure 7: Example of storing Platform and Data Collection
                   Manifest: Vendor PEN and Xpath filter.

   In the labels, the "host" might be different from the
   "platforms_platform_id" in case the collector is the one assembling
   it, i.e. for devices that do not natively support the data manifest.
   In that case, the value of this label could be the hostname of the
   collector.  The host value does not matter for retrieving the data
   manifest as the platform identifier is the meaningful field.

   In this example, retrieving the platform manifest associated to a
   collected datapoint is done by looking for datapoints that have the
   label "platforms_platform_id" equal to the value of the host for that
   collected datapoint.  In order to link a datapoint with the
   corresponding data collection manifest, an additional label for the
   subscription identifier is required.  For instance, the same
   datapoints as in Figure 6 could be stored as in Figure 8.

    * Value: True

      - host: "PE1"

      - data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_subscriptions_
        subscription_id: 4243

       Figure 8: Storing datapoints with information to retrieve the
                               data manifest

   From the "interfaces_interface_enabled" datapoint, one can retrieve
   the corresponding data collection manifest by looking for datapoints
   that have the label data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_collec
   tion_subscriptions_subscription_id equal to 4242.

   Various optimizations could be done, such as relying on on-change
   subscription to modify only the leaves that changed.  In that way,
   the amount of data needed for updating and storing the data manifest
   in the TSDB would be limited.

Appendix C.  Generating YANG Tree Diagrams

   This section provides the files needed to generate the YANG tree
   diagram [RFC8340] from Figure 3.  The diagram was obtained using
   yanglint [yanglint] version 2.1.80, using the YANG Schema Mount
   [RFC8528].  It was manually edited to remove parts irrelevant to this
   document such as data nodes from imported modules, notifications and
   RPCs.

   In order to get a tree diagram involving YANG Schema Mount with
   yanglint, two data files are required, in addition to the YANG
   module, its dependencies and the YANG modules to be mounted.  The
   first required file the extension data, containing the YANG library
   to use at the mount point, this file is provided below as "data-
   collection-extension-data.xml".  The second required file is the YANG
   library to use at the top-level context, this file is provided below
   as "data-collection-toplevel-yanglib.xml".  The following command was
   used to obtain the YANG Tree diagram (before manual edition).
