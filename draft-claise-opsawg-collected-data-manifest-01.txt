                 Data Manifest for Streaming Telemetry
             draft-claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest-01

Abstract

   Most network equipments feature telemetry as a mean to monitoring
   their status.  Several protocols exist to this end; for example, the
   model-driven telemetry governed by YANG models.  These protocols
   provide the data itself, without any contextual information about the
   collection method.  This can render the data unusable if that context
   is lost, for instance when the data is stored without the relevent
   information.  This draft proposes a YANG model to store that
   contextual information, that must be stored along with the collected
   data in order to keep the collected data exploitable.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest           November 2021


2.  Introduction

   Network elements use Model-driven Telemetry (MDT) to continuously
   stream information, both counters and state information.  This
   streamed information is used for network monitoring, directly in the
   data collection, in a closed-loop automation systems, or in a
   database (sometimes called a big data lake) for further analysis.

   When streaming YANG objects with YANG-PUSH [RFC8641], there is a
   semantic definition in the corresponding YANG module definition.  On
   top of that definition, it's also important to understand any
   contextual information about the collection environment.

   As an example, a database could contain a specific counter time
   series.  When analyzing the data, it's important to understand that
   this counter was requested from the network element at specific
   cadence, as this exact cadence might not be observed in the time
   series, potentially implying that the network element was under
   stress.  The same time series might report some values as 0, or might
   even omit some values in the series.  This might be explained by a
   too small observation period, compared to the minimum-observed-period
   [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection].  Again, knowing the
   conditions under which the counter was collected and streamed is key.
   Indeed, taking into account the value of 0 might lead to the wrong
   conclusion that the counter dropped to zero.  This document specifies
   the data manifest, which contains the information how and when the
   telemetry information were metered.

   Precisely identifying the device used for producing the data (that is
   the platform manifest) is also key to complete the collection
   context.  As an example, knowing the exact device software
   specification might reveal a particularity in the observed data,
   explained by a specific bug, or a specific bug fix.  On top of that,
   in particular for MDT, it is crucial to know the set of YANG modules
   supported by the device, along with their deviation.  In some cases,
   there might even be some backwards incompatible changes in native
   modules between one OS version to the next one.  These information
   must be compiled in a platform manifest that must be included in the
   data manifest.

   Some related YANG modules have been specified to discover the device
   capabilities:

   o  [I-D.ietf-netconf-notification-capabilities] which models the
      device capabilities regarding the production and export of
      telemetry data.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest           November 2021


   o  [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection], which is based on
      the previous draft to define the optimal settings to stream
      specfic items (i.e. per path).

   While these YANG modules are important to discover the capabilities
   before applying the telemetry configuration (such as on-change), some
   of this information is part of the context for the streaming data.
   Our goal is to represent the data manifest for a given device.  This
   manifest contains two parts, the platform manifest and the data-
   collection manifest.  The platform manifest is pretty stable and
   should change only when the device is updated or patched.  On the
   other hand, the data collection is likely to change each time a new
   MDT subscription is requested and might even change if the device
   load increases and collection periods are updated.  To separate these
   two parts, we enclose each of them in its own module.  We first
   present the module for the platform manifest in Section 3 and then
   the module for the collection manifest in Section 4.  The full data
   manifest is obtained by combining these two modules.

   This data manifest instance file MUST be streamed all with the data
   and stored along with the collected data.  In case the data are moved
   to different place (typically a database), the data manifest MUST
   follow the collected data.  This can render the data unusable if that
   context is lost, for instance when the data is stored without the
   relevent information.  The data manifest MUST be encoded with the
   YANG instance data file format
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format].  The YANG instance data
   file MUST be updated when the data manifest information changes (for
   example, when a router is upgraded), and the new timestamps MUST be
   used [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-instance-file-format].

   The platform manifest contains all the information to unambiguously
   identify a device.  The platform is identified by a set of parameters
   (platform, software-version, software-flavor, os-version, os-type)
   that are aligned with the YANG Catalog www.yangcatalog.org draft
   [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog] so that the YANG catalog could be
   used to retrieve the YANG modules a posteriori.

   The platform manifest also includes the module-set, as defined in the
   YANG Library [RFC8525].  That module set is particularly useful to
   define to define the paths, as they are based on module names.

   The data-collection container contains the information related to
   individual items collection.  This subtree currently contains only
   information about MDT collection.  It should be extended and
   extendable to represent other kinds of data collection.

   MDT collection is organized in subscriptions.  A given collector can
   subscribe to one ore more subscriptions that usually contain a list
   of paths.  Such a collector only needs the data manifest for
   subscriptions it subscribed to.  The data manifest for MDT is
   organized by subscriptions as well so that a collector can select
   only its subscriptions.  _We now have a chicken-and-egg issue if the
   collector collects the data-manifest via MDT and wants the data-
   manifest for the data-manifest subscription.  First the collector
   will collect the actual paths that it needs in subscription A.  Once

   it has the subscription id for A, it will need an additional
   subscription for B the data manifest of paths in A.  Then, it would
   need another subscription C to fetch the data manifest for the
   subscription B and so on...  A possible solution would be to add an
   additional list that contains the data manifest for every path that
   is a data manifest.  By including that list in subscription B, the
   collector would have the information about subscription B here._

   Within a given collection subscription, the granularity of the
   collection is defined by the path.  Note that all devices do not
   support an arbitrary granularity up to the leaf, usually for
   performance reasons.  Each path currently collected by the device
   should show up in the mdt-path-data-manifest list.

   For each path, the collection context must be specified including:

   o  on-change: when set to true, an update is sent as soon as and only
      when a value changes.  This is also known as Event-Driven
      Telemetry (EDT).  When set to false, the values are sent
      regularly.

   o  suppress-redundancy (only when on-change is false): reduce
      bandwidth usage by sending a regular update only if the value is
      different from the previous update.

   o  requested-period (only when on-change is false): period between
      two updates requested by the client for this path

   o  current-period (only when on-change is false): current period
      between two updates

   This information is crucial to understand the collected values.  For
   instance, the on-change and suppress-redundancy options, if set,
   might remove a lot of messages from the database because values are
   sent only when there is a change.

5.  Mapping data to data manifest

   The data should be mapped to the data manifest.  Since the data
   manifest will not change as frequently as the data itself, it make
   sense to map several data to the same data manifest.  Somehow, the
   collected data must include a metadata pointing to the corresponding
   data manifest.

   The platform manifest is likely to remain the same until the device
   is updated.  So the platform manifest only need to be collected once
   per streaming session and updated after a device reboot.

   With MDT, a particular datapoint is always associated to a path that
   is itself part of a subscription.  In order to enable a posteriori
   retrieval of the data manifest associated to a datapoint, the
   collector must:

   o  keep the path in the metadata of the collected values

   o  collect as well the data-manifest for the subscription and path
      associated to the datapoint.

   With this information, to retrieve the data manifest from the
   datapoint, the following happens:

   o  the path is retrieved from the datapoint metadata

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest           November 2021


   o  the data-manifest for that path is retrieved by looking up on the
      collected data-manifest.

   In that scenario, the reliability of the collection of the data
   manifest is the same as the reliability of the data collection
   itself, since the data manifest is like any other data.  For
   telemetry based on gRPC for instance, a disconnection to the server
   would be detected as the HTTP connection would fail.

9.  Open Issues

   o  Do we want to the hardware specifications, next to the OS
      information?

   o  Do we want to handle the absence of values, i.e. add information
      about missed collection or errors in the collection context ? It
      could also explain why some values are missing.  On the other
      hand, this might also be out scope.

   o  How do we handle other kinds of collection than MDT like netflow,
      SNMP, CLI ? How do we map the collected data to the data-manifest
      ?

   o  Align the terms with the YANG Push specifications.  Ex: path to
      subscription (TBC)

   o  Better explain the on-change example.
