  description
    "This module describes the platform information to be used as
     context of data collection from a given network element. The
     contents of this model must be streamed along with the data
     streamed from the network element so that the platform context
     of the data collection can be retrieved later.

     The data content of this model should not change except on
     upgrade or patching of the device.

     The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL',
     'SHALL NOT', 'SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED',
     'NOT RECOMMENDED', 'MAY', and 'OPTIONAL' in this document
     are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119)
     (RFC 8174) when, and only when, they appear in all
     capitals, as shown here.
