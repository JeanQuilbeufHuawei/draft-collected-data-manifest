           A Data Manifest for Contextualized Telemetry Data
              draft-ietf-opsawg-collected-data-manifest-04

Abstract

   Network platforms use Model-driven Telemetry, and in particular YANG-
   Push, to continuously stream information, including both counters and
   state information.  This document documents the metadata that ensure
   that the collected data can be interpreted correctly.  This document
   specifies the Data Manifest, composed of two YANG data models (the
   Platform Manifest and the Data Collection Manifest).  These YANG
   modules are specified at the network (i.e. controller) level to
   provide a model that encompasses several network platforms.  The Data
   Manifest must be streamed and stored along with the data, up to the
   collection and analytics system in order to keep the collected data
   fully exploitable by the data scientists.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


1.  Introduction

   Network platforms use Model-driven Telemetry (MDT), and in particular
   YANG-Push [RFC8641], to continuously stream information, including
   both counters and state information.

   This document specifies what needs to be kept as metadata (i.e., the
   Data Manifest) to ensure that the collected data can still be
   interpreted correctly throughout the collection and network analytics
   toolchain.  When streaming YANG-structured data with YANG-Push
   [RFC8641], there is a semantic definition in the corresponding YANG
   module definition.  This is the semantic information for the
   collected data nodes: While this semantic is absolutely required to
   correctly decode and interpret the data, understanding the network
   platform and collection environment contexts information is equally
   important to interpret the data.

   This document proposes the Data Manifest, which is composed of two
   YANG data models, namely, the Platform Manifest and the Data
   Collection Manifest, in order to keep the collected data exploitable
   by the data scientists.

   The Platform Manifest contains information characterizing the
   platform streaming the telemetry information, while the the Data
   Collection Manifest contains the required information to characterize
   how and when the telemetry information was metered.

   The two proposed YANG modules in the Data Manifest do not expose many
   new information but rather define what should be exposed by a
   platform streaming or storing telemetry data.  Some related YANG
   modules have been specified to retrieve the platform capabilities:

   *  The IETF YANG Library [RFC8525].

   *  YANG Modules Describing Capabilities for Systems and Datastore
      Update Notifications [RFC9196] for the platform capabilities
      regarding the production and export of telemetry data.

   *  [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection], which is based on
      the previous draft to define the optimal settings to stream
      specific items (i.e., per path).

   These related YANG modules are important to discover the capabilities
   before applying the telemetry configuration (such as on-change).
   Some of their content is part of the context for the streamed data.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


   This documents covers only metadata about the collection context for
   the telemetry.  The collected data is likely to be transformed into
   usable indicators for the network.  The list of such transformation
   operation applied to the data is often called data lineage.
   Supplying the data lineage for the computed indicators is out of
   scope of this document.

   We first present the module for the Platform Manifest in Section 3
   and then the module for the Data Collection Manifest in Section 4.
   The full Data Manifest is obtained by combining these two modules.
   We explain in Section 5 how the Data Manifest can be retrieved and
   how collected data is mapped to the Data Manifest.

1.1.  Use Cases

1.1.1.  Network Analytics

   Streamed information from network platforms is used for network
   analytics, incident detections, and in the end closed-loop
   automation.  This streamed data can be stored in a database
   (sometimes called a big data lake) for further analysis.

   As an example, a database could store a time series representing the
   evolution of a specific counter collected from a network platform.
   When analyzing the data, the network operator/data scientist must
   understand the context information for these data:

   *  This counter definition in the YANG model.

   *  The network platform specific vendor, model, and OS.

   *  The collection parameters.

   Characterizing the source used for producing the data (vendor,
   platform, and OS) is useful to complement the data.  As an example,
   knowing the exact data source software specification might reveal a
   particularity in the observed data, explained by a specific bug, a
   specific bug fix, or simply a particular specific behavior.  This is
   also necessary to ensure the reliability of the collected data.  On
   top of that, in particular for YANG-Push [RFC8641], it is crucial to
   know the set of YANG modules supported by the platform, along with
   their deviations.  In some cases, there might even be some backwards
   incompatible changes in native modules between one OS version to the
   next one.  This information is captured by the proposed Platform
   Manifest.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


   From a collection parameters point of view, the data scientists
   analyzing the collected data must know that the counter was requested
   from the network platform as on-change or at specific cadence.
   Indeed, an on-change collection explains why there is a single value
   as opposed to a time series.  In case of periodic collection, this
   exact cadence might not be observable in the time series.  Indeed,
   this time series might report some values as 0 or might even omit
   some values.  The reason for this behavior might be diverse: the
   network platform was under stress, with a too small observation
   period, compared to the minimum-observed-period
   [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection].  Again, knowing the
   conditions under which the counter was collected and streamed (along
   with the platform details) help drawing the right conclusions.  As an
   example, taking into account the value of 0 might lead to a wrong
   conclusion that the counter dropped to zero.  This document specifies
   the Data Collection Manifest, which contains the required information
   to characterize how and when the telemetry information was metered.

   The goal of the current document is to define what needs to be kept
   as metadata (i.e., the Data Manifest) to ensure that the collected
   data can still be interpreted correctly.

1.1.2.  New Device Onboarding

   When a new device is onboarded, operators must make sure that the new
   device streams data with YANG-Push, that the telemetry data is the
   right ones, that the data is correctly ingested in the collection
   system, and finally that the data can be analyzed (compared with
   other similar devices).  For the last point, the Data Manifest, which
   must be linked to the data up to the collection and analytics system,
   contains all the relevant information.

1.1.3.  Data Mesh Principles in Networking

   The concept behind the data mesh https://www.datamesh-
   architecture.com/ are:

   *  Principle of Domain Ownership: Architecturally and
      organizationally align business, technology, and analytical data,
      following the line of responsibility.  Here, the Data Mesh
      principles adopt the boundary of bounded context to individual
      data products where each domain is responsible for (and owns) its
      data and models.

   *  Principle of Data as a Product: The “Domain” owners are
      responsible to provide the data in useful way (discoverable
      through a catalog, addressable with a permanent and unique
      address, understandable with well defined semantics, trustworthy

      and truthful, self-describing for easy consumption, interoperable
      by supporting standards, secure, self-contained, etc.) and should
      treat consumers of that data as customers.  It requires and relies
      on the “Domain Ownership” principle.

   *  Principle of Self-serve Data Platform: This fosters the sharing of
      cross-domain data in order to create extra value.

   *  Principle of Federated Computational Governance: Describes the
      operating model and approach to establishing global policies
      across a mesh of data products.

   The most relevant concept for this document is the "Data as a
   Product" principle.  The Data Manifest fulfills this principle as the
   two YANG data models, Platform Manifest and the Data Collection
   Manifest, along with the data, provide all the necessary information
   in a self-describing way for easy consumption.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Data Manifest: all the necessary data required to interpret the
   telemetry information.

   Platform Manifest: part of the Data Manifest that completely
   characterizes the platform producing the telemetry information

   Data Collection Manifest: part of the Data Manifest that completely
   characterizes how and when the telemetry information was metered.

       Figure 1: YANG tree diagram for ietf-platform-manifest module

   The YANG module actually contains a list of Platform Manifests (in
   'platforms/platform'), indexed by the identifier of the platform.
   That identifier should be defined by the network manager so that each
   platform has a unique id.  As an example, the identifier could be the
   'sysname' from the ietf-notification module presented in
   [I-D.tgraf-netconf-notif-sequencing].  The scope of this module is
   the scope of the data collection, i.e. a given network, therefore it
   contains a collection of Platform Manifests, as opposed to the device
   scope, which would contain a single Platform Manifest.

   The Platform Manifest is identified by a set of parameters ('name',
   'software-version', 'software-flavor', 'os-version', 'os-type') that
   are aligned with the YANG Catalog www.yangcatalog.org
   [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog] so that the YANG Catalog could be
   used to retrieve the YANG modules a posteriori.  The vendor of the
   platform can be identified via its name 'vendor' or its PEN number
   'vendor-pen', as described in [RFC9371].

   In order to provide information for yang-push subscriptions based on
   streams, the Platform Manifest specifies the streams available on the
   platform within the 'yang-push-streams' container.  That container is
   similar to the one from the ietf-subscribed-notifications module, and
   the Data Collection Manifest uses it to refer to streams used by
   subscriptions.

   The Platform Manifest also includes the contents of the YANG Library
   [RFC8525].  That module set is particularly useful to define the
   paths, as they are based on module names.  Similarly, this module
   defines the available datastores, which can be referred to from the
   Data Manifest, if necessary.  If supported by the platform, fetching
   metrics from a specific datastore could enable some specific use
   cases: monitoring configuration before it is committed, comparing
   between the configuration and operational datastore.

4.  Data Collection Manifest

4.1.  Overview of the Model

   Figure 2 contains the YANG tree diagram [RFC8340] of the ietf-data-
   collection-manifest module.

   module: ietf-data-collection-manifest
     +--ro data-collections
        +--ro data-collection* [platform-id]
           +--ro platform-id
           |       -> /p-mf:platforms/platform/id
           +--ro yang-push-collection?   <anydata>

    Figure 2: YANG tree diagram for ietf-data-collection-manifest module

   The 'data-collections' container contains the information related to
   each YANG-Push subscription.  As for the Platform Manifest, these
   subscriptions are indexed by the platform id, so that all
   subscriptions in the network can be represented in the module.

   The YANG-Push collection is organized in subscriptions, the
   parameters for such a subscription are specified in [RFC8639] and
   [RFC8641].  The list of subscriptions from a given platform is stored
   in '/data-collection/data-collection/yang-push-subscriptions/
   subscription'.  Subscription metadata are the bulk of the Data
   Collection Manifest, they are heavily based on the two RFCs above.

   The 'target' choice specify the selected contents for the
   subscription.  We did not include the target with a reference to a
   common filter as stored in 'filters' in ietf-subscribed-notfications.
   The rationale for this choice is that otherwise we would need to
   store these filters in the Platform Manifest, which could cause
   changes in that manifest more often than needed.  If a stream based
   subscription is used [RFC8639], the stream must exist in the 'yang-
   push-streams' container of Platform Manifest, which is modelled as a
   leafref in our module.  If a datastore based subscription is used
   [RFC8641], the datastore must exist in the 'yang-library' container
   of the Platform Manifest, which is modelled by a leafref as well.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


   We also included 'transport', 'encoding' and 'purpose' as in ietf-
   subscribed-notification, but without the feature switches as we are
   not concerned about using this module for configuration.

   We also included the 'dscp', 'weighting' and 'dependency' as in ietf-
   subscribed-notification, again without the feature switches.  This
   information might be useful to understand why the collection is
   failing or less frequent than expected for a given subscription.

   The 'update-trigger' choice from ietf-yang-push is included as well,
   as it is crucial to understand the frequency at which notifications
   should arrive.

   The only new content is the 'current-period', which might differ from
   the requested period (when in periodic collection mode) if the
   platform implements a mechanism to increase the collection period
   when it is overloaded.

   Finally, we also included the state of the receivers for that
   subscription, as in ietf-subscribed-notifications.

   This information is crucial to understand the collected values.  For
   instance, the 'on-change' trigger, if used, might remove a lot of
   messages from the database because values are sent only when there is
   a change.

5.  Data Manifest and the Collected Data

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


5.1.  Collecting the Data Manifest

   The Data Manifest MUST be streamed and stored along with the
   collected data.  In case the collected data are moved to a different
   place (typically a database), the Data Manifest MUST follow the
   collected data.  This can render the collected data unusable if that
   context is lost, for instance when the data is stored without the
   relevant information.  The Data Manifest MUST be updated when the
   Data Manifest information changes, for example, when a router is
   upgraded, when a new telemetry subscription is configured, or when
   the telemetry subscription parameters change.  The Data Manifest can
   itself be considered as a time series, and stored in a similar
   fashion to the collected data.

   The collected data should be mapped to the Data Manifest.  Since the
   Data Manifest will not change as frequently as the collected data
   itself, it makes sense to map several data to the same Data Manifest.
   Somehow, the collected data must include a metadata pointing to the
   corresponding Data Manifest.  In case of Data Manifest change, the
   system should keep the mapping between the data collected so far and
   the old Data Manifest, and not assume that the latest Data Manifest
   is valid for the entire time series.

   The Platform Manifest is likely to remain the same until the platform
   is updated.  Thus, the Platform Manifest only needs to be collected
   once per streaming session and updated after a platform reboot.

   As this draft specifically focuses on giving context on data
   collected via streamed telemetry, we can assume that a streaming
   telemetry system is available.  Retrieving the Data Collection
   Manifest and Platform Manifest can be done either by reusing that
   streaming telemetry system (in-band) or using another system (out-of-
   band), for instance by adding headers or saving manifests into a YANG
   instance file [RFC9195].

   We propose to reuse the existing telemetry system (in-band approach)
   in order to lower the efforts for implementing this draft.  To enable
   a platform supporting streaming telemetry to also support the Data
   Manifest, it is sufficient that this platform supports the models
   from Section 3 and Section 4.  Recall that each type of manifest has
   its own rough frequency update, i.e. at reboot for the Platform
   Manifest and at new subscription or CPU load variation for the Data
   Collection Manifest.  The Data Manifest MUST be streamed with the
   YANG-Push on-change feature [RFC8641] (also called event-driven
   telemetry).  Appendix A shows how the in-band approach would work
   while storing to a time-series database (TSDB).

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


5.2.  Mapping Collected Data to the Data Manifest

   With YANG-push, each notification sent by the device is part of a
   subscription, which is also one of the YANG keys used to retrieve the
   Data Manifest, the other key being the platform ID.  In order to
   enable a posteriori retrieval of the Data Manifest associated to a
   datapoint, the collector must:

   *  Keep the subscription id and platform id in the metadata of the
      collected values

   *  Collect as well the Data Manifest for the subscription associated
      to the datapoint.

   With this information, to retrieve the Data Manifest from the
   datapoint, the following happens:

   *  The subscription id and platform id are retrieved from the
      datapoint metadata

   *  The Data Manifest for that datapoint is obtained by using the
      values above as keys.

   We don’t focus on the timing aspect as storing both the data and
   their manifest in a time series database (TSDB) will allow the data
   scientists to look for the Data Manifest corresponding to the
   timestamp of the datapoint.  More precisely, given the timestamp of a
   collected datapoint, the query to the TSDB would be to get the last
   version of the Data Manifest before that timestamp.  In that
   scenario, the reliability of the collection of the Data Manifest is
   the same as the reliability of the data collection itself, since the
   Data Manifest is like any other data.

5.3.  Operational Considerations

   It is expected that the Data Manifest is streamed directly from the
   network equipment, along with YANG-Push [RFC8641] data.  However, if
   the network equipment streaming telemetry does not support yet the
   YANG modules from the Data Manifest specified in this document, the
   telemetry collector could populate the Data Manifest from available
   information collected from the platform.  However, this option
   requires efforts on the telemetry collector side, as the information
   gathered in the Data Manifest proposed in this document could be
   scattered among various standard and vendor- specific YANG modules
   [RFC8199], that depend on the platform.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest               July 2024


   That Data Manifest should be kept and available even if the source
   platform is not accessible (from the collection system), or if the
   platform has been updated (new operating system or new
   configuration).  The Platform Manifest is "pretty" stable and should
   change only when the platform is updated or patched.  On the other
   hand, the Data Collection Manifest is likely to change each time a
   new YANG-Push subscription [RFC8641] is requested and might even
   change if the platform load increases and collection periods are
   updated.  To separate these two parts, we enclose each of them in its
   own module.

6.  Example

   Below is an example of both a Platform manifest and corresponding
   Data Collection Manifests.  The list of YANG modules in the yang-
   library container is kept empty for brevity.

   The file above contains the Data Collection Manifest for two Xpaths
   subscriptions.  With the Data Collection Manifest for the first one,
   with subscription id 4242, the exact semantics of the collected path,
   here the administrative status of the network interfaces, can be
   obtained by looking up the module in the yang-library of the
   corresponding Platform Manifest, in order to obtain the exact
   revision of ieft-interfaces used at collection time.  Also, the "on-
   change" container indicates that data will be sent only if there is a
   change, thus not receiving data indicates that the administrative
   status of the interface did not change.

   The other example of Data Collection Manifest, with subscription id
   4243, shows how a periodic subscription is reported.  In that
   example, the current-period indicates that the requested period of
   10s (1000 centiseconds) could not be attained and is now of 20s, for
   instance because the device is overloaded.

7.  Security Considerations

   As we are reusing an existing telemetry system, the security
   considerations lies with the new content divulged in the new
   manifests.  Appropriate access control must be associated to the
   corresponding leafs and containers.

   The integrity and provenance of the data of the collection manifest
   can be ensured by a signing mechanism such as
   [I-D.lopez-opsawg-yang-provenance].

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

10.  Open Issues

   *  Do we want to handle the absence of values, i.e. add information
      about missed collection or errors in the collection context ? It
      could also explain why some values are missing.  On the other
      hand, this might also be out scope.

   *  Regarding the inclusion of ietf-yang-library in our module, do we
      want to include as well the changes from ietf-yang-library-
      revisions?  What if other information are present in the yang-
      library from the platform?  Should we use a YANG mount to capture
      them as well (they would not be captured with our use of the main

      yang-library grouping).  Similarly, the ietf-data-collection-
      manifest.yang includes many lines of copy-pasting from ietf-yang-
      push.yang and ietf-subscribed-notifications.yang since we want to
      include the information from these modules.  Reusing groupings is
      not suitable as some leafrefs are pointing to nodes that are not
      at the same location in our network level module.  Maybe we need
      to find a solution (deviations + some kind of schema mount?) maybe
      we can live with similar modules since they have common nodes but
      different purposes?  Current effort in
      [I-D.jouqui-netmod-yang-full-include] might be a potential
      solution.

   *  Henk: how does this interact with SBOM effort?

   *  What is the link with the RFC8345 NodeId and IVY?

   *  Handling of deletion in [I-D.kll-yang-label-tsdb].

Appendix A.  title="Example of use based on MDT

   In this example, the goal is to collect the administrative status and
   number of received bytes for the interfaces of a fictional ACME
   device, and store the result in a time-series database (TSDB).  The
   metrics are collected via YANG-Push, which is configured by
   specifying their XPaths and when they should be collected
   (periodically or on-change).  More precisely, we want collect "ietf-
   interfaces:interfaces/interface/enabled" on every change and "ietf-
   interfaces:interfaces/interface/statistics/in-octets" every 100
   milliseconds.  The paths here are referring to the YANG module from
   [RFC8343].  The configuration of YANG push is out of scope for this
   document.  Since they don’t have the same trigger, each of the path
   must be collected in its own subscription.  Figure 4 presents an
   example for such a collection.

          Figure 4: Example of collection from a device to a TSDB

   In the scenario from Figure 4, the collector receives YANG-push from
   the device and stores it into a TSDB.  We first present a version
   without Data Manifest and then how to enrich it with the Data
   Manifest.

   We use the notation from [I-D.kll-yang-label-tsdb] to represent how
   the data is stored in the TSDB.  Without the data manifest, the
   result of the collection would be stored as showed in Figure 5.  The
   "host" label indicates the devices from which the data is collected
   and the YANG keys are included as well.  Here the interface "eth0" is
   enabled and received 1234 octets.  In that case, the value is stored,
   without any way to know how the value was obtained.

    * Metric: interfaces_interface_enabled
    * Value: True
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - interfaces_interface_name: "eth0"
   --
    * Metric: interfaces_interface_statistics_in_octets
    * Value: 1234
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - interfaces_interface_name: "eth0"

             Figure 5: Storing datapoints without Data Manifest

   A possibility for keeping the Data Manifest with the data is to store
   it directly into the TSDB.  In that case, the collector can subscribe
   to the data exported by the module presented in this draft and store
   it as other metrics.  For the Platform Manifest, assuming the
   platform ID is "PE1", the collector subscribes to the path "ietf-
   platform-manifest:platforms/platform[id=PE1]".  For the Data
   Collection Manifests, the collector subscribes to the path "ietf-
   data-collection-manifest:data-collections/data-collection[platform-

   id="PE1"]/yang-push-subscriptions/subscription[id=X]" where X is the
   subscription id of existing subscriptions.  With the approach from
   [I-D.kll-yang-label-tsdb], the corresponding subtrees would be split
   into a set of datapoints, one per leaf.  Figure 6 shows two examples
   of storing leaves in a TSDB.  The first leaf is the vendor PEN
   number, which is part of the Platform Manifest.  The second leaf is
   the Xpath filter used for subscription to the interface status.

    * Metric: platforms_platform_vendor_pen
    * Value: 32473
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - platforms_platform_id: "PE1"
   --
    * Metric: data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_subscriptions_
              subscription_datastore_xpath_filter
    * Value: "ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface/enabled"
    * Labels:
      - host: "PE1"
      - data_collections_data_collection_platform_id: "PE1"
      - data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_subscriptions_
        subscription_id: 4242

         Figure 6: Example of storing Platform and Data Collection
                   Manifest: Vendor PEN and Xpath filter.

   In the labels, the "host" might be different from the
   "platforms_platform_id" in case the collector is the one assembling
   it, i.e. for devices that do not natively support the Data Manifest.
   In that case, the value of this label could be the hostname of the
   collector.  The host value does not matter for retrieving the Data
   Manifest as the platform id is the meaningful field.

   In our example, we can retrieve the Platform Manifest associated to a
   collected datapoint by looking for datapoints that have the label
   "platforms_platform_id" equal to the value of the host for that
   collected datapoint.  In order to link a datapoint with the
   corresponding Data Collection Manifest, we need to add an additional
   label for the subscription id.  For instance, the same datapoints as
   in Figure 5 could be stored as in Figure 7.

       Figure 7: Storing datapoints with information to retrieve the
                               Data Manifest

   From the "interfaces_interface_enabled" datapoint, one can retrieve
   the corresponding Data Collection Manifest by looking for datapoints
   that have the label data_collections_data_collection_yang_push_subscr
   iptions_subscription_id equal to 4242.

   Various optimizations could be done, such as relying on on-change
   subscription to modify only the leaves that changed.  In that way,
   the amount of data needed for updating and storing the Data Manifest
   in the TSDB would be limited.

Appendix C.  Supporting files for generating YANG tree diagrams

   This section provides the files needed to generate the YANG tree
   diagrams [RFC8340] from Figure 1 and Figure 2.  The diagrams were
   obtained using yanglint https://github.com/CESNET/libyang version
   2.1.80, using the YANG Schema Mount [RFC8528].  Once
   [I-D.jouqui-netmod-yang-full-include] is implemented, they should be
   replaced by the tree diagrams produced directly from the
   corresponding modules.  Alternatively, the present section could be
   used as the standard, if [I-D.jouqui-netmod-yang-full-include] does
   not become an RFC.

   In order to get the tree diagram with yanglint, two data files are
   required.  First we need the extension data, containing the YANG
   library to use at the mount point.  Then we need the YANG library to
   use at the top-level context.  The extension data is included below
   as "platform-extension-data.xml", the top-level YANG library as
   "platform-toplevel-yanglib.xml".  The tree diagram is obtained by
   running the following command:

   yanglint -f tree \
     -x platform-extension-data.xml \
     -Y platform-toplevel-yanglib.xml \
     ietf-platform-manifest@2024-07-02.yang
